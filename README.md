  Glastonbury Ticket Registration
  <br>
</h1>

## Problem
Every year Glastonbury Festival sells out in a matter of minutes ðŸ˜­ 

The current system requires that you register online and then when tickets go on sale you join a massive queue to buy them. 

Often you get through to a multi-stage form and then due to the sheer amount of traffic the website crashes and you lose your place in the queue causing frustration for you as a customer and negative PR for the festival organizers. It's also a bit unfair for people who get tickets year after year just because of sheer luck.

## Solution 
- A new fair ticket system will allow individuals to pre-register and add up to 5 members to their account for family/friends who they want to take with them.

- The tickets will then be released from the pool on release day. Customers who are selected will receive a private email invite to claim their tickets within 48 hours before they are released back into the pool. (Yay no more queuing)

- We can easily track what users were allocated tickets last year and update their likelihood of being selected again.

Additional features such as VIP/Artist tickets along with QR code and barcode scanning will also be implemented.
